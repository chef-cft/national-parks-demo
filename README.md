# Enterprise Automation Stack - National Parks - Java Tomcat Application
This is an example Java Tomcat application packaged by [Habitat](https://habitat.sh) on VMs hardened and patched by Chef Infra and Audited by Inspec using the "Effortless" pattern. This example app has existed for some time, and another example can be found [here](https://github.com/habitat-sh/national-parks). The differences with this example versus previous examples are the following:

- `core/mongodb` - Previous examples had you build a version of mongodb that was already populated with data before the application
- `mongo.toml` - This repo includes a `user.toml` file for overriding the default configuration of mongodb
- `core/haproxy` = This repo uses the `core/haproxy` package as a loadbalancer in front of National Parks
- Scaling - In both the `terrform/azure` and `terraform/aws` plans there is a `count` variable which allows you to scale out the web instances to demonstrate the concept of choreography vs orchestration in Habitat.


## Usage
In order run this repo, you must first install Habitat. You can find setup docs on the [Habitat Website](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/install-habitat/).

### Terraform Note
This repository contains Terraform code that is now written to Terraform 0.12.x specs.  It is HIGHLY recommended to use [tfswitch](https://warrensbox.github.io/terraform-switcher/) if you are not already using it.  This repo contains .tfswitchrc files that will automatically enable the right version of terraform, assuming you have that functionality set up in your terminal emulator.  See the end of the tfswitch homepage under the heading `Use .tfswitchrc file` for more information.
