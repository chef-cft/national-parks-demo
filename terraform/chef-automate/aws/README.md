Note: On prompt, Terraform will ask for a password to be used with Automate, however no validation is currently in place. You must meet all minimum password requirements. For example: It must be at least 8 characters.
Currently, if you do not meet password requirements, Terrafrom will not show any signs of failing. However, you will not be able to login to Automate.
